# Spelling Bee App - DanBox
### Not the final name, I promise

Made with Love2D, this is the app part of my project to make a party game where the "controllers" are your phone or device - also known as the Jackbox.TV model. The current state of the app/server is about 80%~ ish of the way to being a playable proof of concept. Currently hashing out the main gameplay loop - after I have something playable, then I'll start to double back on everything and try to make it look nicer.

I've done my best to be relatively thorough with my Lua type annotations, especially for my UI components, but the project would still be served well for me to make another pass giving further comments/documentation.

My rough order for my to do list is:

- Finish main gameplay loop
- Refine UI library - might be split into its own project
- Provide further code clarification via comments and more official documentation
- Polish, polish, and fix all the bugs

And obviously, much more to come.
